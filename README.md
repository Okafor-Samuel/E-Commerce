# Microservice E-commerce Platform

## Overview
This project aims to develop a microservice-based e-commerce platform utilizing Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Keycloak for authentication and authorization. The platform will provide a scalable, modular architecture allowing easy management and extension of individual services, ensuring high availability, and providing a seamless shopping experience for users.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Provides a robust framework for building Java-based applications, offering a wide range of built-in functionalities for creating production-ready microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: Facilitates the development of distributed systems by providing tools for service discovery, configuration management, load balancing, circuit breakers, and more.
- **Keycloak**: An open-source Identity and Access Management solution that integrates easily with Spring applications, providing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Key Features
### User Management:
- User registration and login
- Profile management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) using Keycloak

### Product Management:
- CRUD operations for products
- Product categorization and search functionality
- Inventory management

### Order Management:
- Order creation and tracking
- Shopping cart functionality
- Payment integration

### Service Discovery and Configuration Management:
- Service discovery using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka
- Centralized configuration management with Spring Cloud Config

### API Gateway:
- Centralized entry point for all client requests using Spring Cloud Gateway
- Load balancing, routing, and security

### Security:
- Authentication and authorization using Keycloak
- Secure communication between microservices

## Architecture
The platform follows a microservices architecture, where each component is a standalone service that communicates with others through REST APIs. The main components include:

### User Service:
- Manages user information and interactions
- Integrates with Keycloak for authentication and authorization

### Product Service:
- Handles all product-related operations
- Manages product inventory and details

### Order Service:
- Manages order processing and tracking
- Integrates with payment gateways

### API Gateway:
- Routes incoming requests to the appropriate services
- Provides load balancing and security

### Config Server:
- Centralized management of configuration properties for all microservices

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Spring Boot applications for each microservice.
2. Integrate Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka for service discovery.
3. Configure Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management.
4. Set up Keycloak for user authentication and authorization.
5. Develop RESTful APIs for each microservice.
6. Implement API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway.
7. Secure communication between services with Keycloak.
8. Deploy the microservices on a cloud platform or a container orchestration system like Kubernetes.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its load.
- **Modularity**: Easier maintenance and enhancements as each service is developed and deployed independently.
- **Security**: Centralized and robust security mechanisms using Keycloak.
- **Flexibility**: Easy integration of new features and third-party services without affecting the existing system.

This project showcases the power of combining Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Keycloak to build a modern, secure, and scalable e-commerce platform, catering to the needs of today's dynamic business environment.
